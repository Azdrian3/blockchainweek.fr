    Please join Melanie, Founder & CEO of WOM Token, Daniel Wingen,
      Blockchain Economics Designer, and Conner Howe, Lead Blockchain
      Developer, for a journey into the ecosystem that will enable any brand,
      advertiser, and content distribution platform to adopt the WOM Token and
      connect with content creators and their peers on a global scale.
  -
    An estimated 2.1 billion daily product recommendations are made online,
      yet brands and advertisers do not have an effective and scalable way to
      properly incentivize, monetize, and measure peer-to-peer
      recommendations. Until now.
  -
    We are introducing the WOM Token as a simple and transparent means for
      rewarding peer-to-peer recommendations in a scalable and robust economy
      leveraging the power of the blockchain.
  -
    Based on blockchain technology, the WOM Token enables brands and
      advertisers to connect directly to these 2.1 billion digital
      word-of-mouth conversations and rewards the creator for their product
      recommendations.
