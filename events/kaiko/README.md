description: 
  Smart contracts require external data if they're to solve the important problems that go beyond tokenization. 
  In this demo, you'll learn how to connect a smart contract to external, off-chain data using Chainlink's decentralized oracle network. 
  We'll start by creating a Chainlink smart contract that requests cryptocurrency market data from Kaiko. Then we'll feed that data into a smart contract to automatically trigger transactions based on crypto fiat prices.
