synopsis:

    We are pleased to invite you to a roundtable featuring Opera, HTC, Infura and ConsenSys Paris for a panel on; "The Future of Web 3, a vision of a better Internet."

    The newly launched blockchain-centric smartphone Exodus, developed by consumer electronics giant HTC, has partnered with web browser Opera as well as added support for multiple DApps.

    The integration Exodus with Opera enables users to access the browserâ€™s native Ethereum wallet to make crypto payments and micropayment on websites that support it.

    Opera for Android accesses the Ethereum blockchain through Infura, an infrastructure platform that provides secure, reliable, and scalable access to Ethereum.

    WIRED says, "If a smartphone and a crypto wallet had a baby, it would look like the Exodus 1." TechRadar says, "HTC Exodus 1 blockchain phone could help build the next Internet."
