synopsis:
  - 
      In this day-long training, JP Smith will share how Trail of Bits conducts our security reviews; not just our tools or tricks, but the whole approach. In addition to that knowledge, he’ll share our school of thought regarding assessments. Far too often, we encounter the belief that audits deliver a list of bugs and, consequently, the ability to say “Our code has been audited!” (and therefore “Our code is safe!”). That’s just part of the picture. Audits should also deliver an assessment of total project risk, guidance on architectural and development lifecycle, and someone to talk to. 
  - 
      That’s the framework attendees will come away with.
