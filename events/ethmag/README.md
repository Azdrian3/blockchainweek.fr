synopsis:
  -
        Ethereum Magicians Council is a regular gathering of Ethereum Community focused on current progress and challenges in Ethereum community and technology. In contrast to usual conferences and meetups where preselected speakers presenting their work to broader audience, Magicians Councils are organized around working groups called Rings. These are open for anyone in Ethereum community to propose and participate. The goal of the Council is to facilitate communication in the community across usual circles. It gives anyone a chance to be heard, to understand concerns of others, to find colleagues to work together on a topic, or to start a new project relevant to the community.
