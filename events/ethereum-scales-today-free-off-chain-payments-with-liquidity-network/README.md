    Liquidity Network - Liquidity Network solves the pressing scalability
      problems of existing blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. By using
      novel off-chain technology, the Liquidity Network offers a network of
      payment hubs where funds are not locked up between two users, routing is
      significantly reduced and payment channels are rebalanced off-chain.
      Liquidity Network is based on academic research with REVIVE, a novel
      protocol that allows to refund payment channels off-chain and NOCUST, a
      non-custodial 2nd-layer financial intermediary, complementing REVIVE.
