    bio: Centrifuge OS is an open protocol for the financial supply chain. It allows businesses to exchange financial documents in a private, verifiable and secure way while supporting on-chain document validation. Users can tokenize their business documents (such as invoices, purchase orders, etc.) and use them as collateral for decentralized trade finance. We hope for a future of data sovereignty, equal access to financial resources and breaking down the data silos and walled gardens in which data of the financial supply chain currently resides.

    bio: The DutchX is an open, decentralized trading protocol for ERC-20 tokens using the Dutch auction mechanism for determining a fair value for tokens. Coupled with a pure on-chain design, the DutchX doubles a price oracle and is built to enable users, bots, as well as other smart contracts to exchange tokens; no strategy for participation is needed. Trading on the DutchX, users benefit from getting a fair price for their tokens through the bundling of liquidity. Additionally, all fees levied in the exchange remain in the exchange — no value is extracted! Any decentralized application in need of exchanging tokens or integrating a price feed can make use of the DutchX. The possibilities are tremendous! The DutchX will soon be governed by the dxDAO. Check out https://slow.trade - a graphical user interface that lets you interact with the DutchX. An interface for bidders will also be available shortly.
