synopsis:
  - 
      A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency which has a pegged value. This means that the value of that cryptocurrency should not go up and down like normal cryptoassets do. In most cases, the peg is to the US dollar.

      Stablecoins can be pegged to nearly anything, in theory, it could be pegged to euros or to any other asset like gold or even wheat. What differs for stablecoins is how the peg is maintained, and the entire system is based on trust. That is, trust that the issuer of the coin can maintain the currencyâ€™s value.

      We are glad to host the State of Stablecoins during the Community Blockchain Week in France (https://blockchainweek.fr/).

      This panel will explore the past, present, and future of Stablecoins and try to understand what are the legal, technical and economic challenges ahead.
