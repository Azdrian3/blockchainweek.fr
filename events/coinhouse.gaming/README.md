synopsis:
  - 
      Since the launch of CryptoKitties – a digital cat-breeding game built on Ethereum – roughly a year ago, games have provided a digitally native playground for early adopters to experiment with the unique benefits of open protocols. Currently, most of the top dapps by transaction volume are games.

      Undoubtedly, blockchain is still on the hunt for its ‘killer app’, it's perfect use-case that can send it on its way to being a usable and functional tool that lives up to its potential.
