    What is ERC 725?
  -
    ERC 725 is a proposed standard for blockchain-based identity authored by
      Fabian Vogelsteller, creator of ERC 20 and Web3.js. ERC 725 describes
      proxy smart contracts that can be controlled by multiple keys and other
      smart contracts. ERC 735 is an associated standard to add and remove
      claims to an ERC 725 identity smart contract. These identity smart
      contracts can describe humans, groups, objects, and machines. ERC 725
      lives on the Ethereum blockchain.
