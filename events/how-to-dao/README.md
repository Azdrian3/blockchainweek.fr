synopsis:
  -
    This will be the first event funded, governed and organized according to a
      proposal on the Genesis Alpha DAO (and by a DAO in general to the best of
      our knowledge, excluding masternodes).
  -
    On the occasion of the Berlin Blockchain Week, we are tying together
      various actors, building the tools and communities that will form the
      basis of a decentralized governance ecosystem.
  -
    This includes talks/roundtables concerning decentralized on-chain
      governance protocols, the use of crypto-economic primitives to align
      incentives and build new models for Justice, IP rights, prediction
      markets and others as well as observations on past experiments and
      lessons for future DAOs.
  -
    We will also be showcasing DAOstack's Alchemy and the experience of the
      Genesis DAO which funded this event via a vote of its reputation
      holders.
  -
    On a brighter note, will have decentraly funded beer and pizza for this
      great occasion.
  -
    We can't conclude before thanking to our partner Blockchain Embassy for
      their generous hospitaly!
  -
    Due to space limitations we'll only be able to host a limited number of
      participants so please RSVP.
